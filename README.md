Project Proposal for Photo using Voice Recognition

Sensors involved in the project:
Camera and Microphone

Main goal (paragraph):
The main goal of the project is to capture a photo when the user claps or makes a specific sound near the microphone and by using voice recognition, the android app should use the camera in the smartphone to automatically detect the sound and take a picture. Any sounds can be used for this purpose.

Application scenario design (paragraph):
It is inconvenient to take pictures of yourself when travelling alone, selfies usually limit the background. And when we use a short timer we have to rush back from the camera to your photo location. This application would help with in such cases where the user can simply keep the phone with the camera pp open and clap to take a picture of himself. Other sounds like finger snaps or whistles can also be used with the application.

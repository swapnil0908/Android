VoiceCam(Photo using Voice Recognition)

Sensors involved in the project:
Camera and Microphone

Main goal (paragraph):
The main goal of the project is to capture a photo when the user says a specific word near the microphone, in this case we are using the word "cheese" and by using the SpeechRecognition Intent, the android app would use the camera in the smartphone to automatically detect the word and take a picture. The application can be programmed such that any words can be used for this purpose.

Application scenario design (paragraph):

It is inconvenient to take pictures of yourself when travelling alone, selfies usually limit the background. And when we use a short timer we have to rush back from the camera to your photo location. This application would help with in such cases where the user can simply keep the phone with the VoiceCam app open and simply say "cheese" to take a picture of himself/herself.
